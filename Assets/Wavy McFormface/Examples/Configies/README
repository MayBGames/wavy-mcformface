These are the Configie assets which power waveforms.

A Configie can be shared across multiple WavyMcFormface instances. Since the
PlayControls.CurrentOctave and PlayControls.NoteIndex properties are not saved
to a Configie asset, different waveforms can play different notes in different
octaves using the same Harmonics, FrequencyLimit, Volume.Level, WibbleWobble,
WaveVolumes, and Noise settings.
