O HAI!

These scenes will hopefully help you get your feet wet with Wavy McFormface!

The Sound Fun scene has three pre-made waveforms. Just play the scene and mess
around with them :-)

The Game On scene has super-amazing-87k-InfinitiHD-HRRazzle graphics and is so
immersive you won't even notice that it's just two floating cylindars, one
floating cube, some text, and fun examples of how you can adjust waveform
properties at runtime!

The Scripts folder next to this one has all the scripts attached to the
GameObjects. Feel free to look through them and experiment by updating different
properties.

Have fun!
