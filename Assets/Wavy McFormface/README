Hello and Welcome to Wavy McFormface!

Thank you so much for buying this plugin. If you have any questions or issues
please checkout http://bsgbryan.com/wavy-mcformface or post to the unity forums
for this plugin.

To get started, simply select Tools -> Wavy McFormface -> New Waveform. Once
you give your waveform a name and select where you'd like the configie asset to
be saved you'll see a new GameObject added to your scene (with the name you
chose in the save dialog). This GameObject will have the WavyMcFormface script,
with the newly-created configie asset attached, as well as an AudioSource. The
AudioSource is extremely important: without it no sound will be produced.

*NOTE: Each GameObject with an instance of WavyMcFormface attached to it must
also have an AudioSource attached to it.*

If you select the newly-created GameObject and expand the Wavy Mc Formface
component you'll see the beautiful custom inspector panel. This panel is used to
sculpt your waveform.

If you Play the scene, select a "current octave" of 3 or 4 from the Play
Controls section (just to make sure it's easy to hear) and click "play" for one
of the notes you'll hear your waveform! This is not a pre-recorded audio file or
midi sample. This is a waveform generated in real time as you listen!

While the waveform is playing you can use the inspector to adjust the wave's
properties to customize it until it's exactly what you want. All your updates
will persist when the scene stops playing.

Now; have fun customizing your wave, check out the Examples directory, and make
something awesome!




And thanks again for buying Wavy. I really appreciate it.
